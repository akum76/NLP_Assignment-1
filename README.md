About the Natural Language Processing Course
This course gives an overview of the topics of study of the field of Natural Language Processing. It takes a problem-centric approach, introducing increasingly more complex problems, starting from basic building blocks like language modeling, tagging and parsing; and progressing towards complex problems like opinion mining, machine translation, question & answering and dialogue. While important historical methods will be mentioned (and studied if still relevant), a focus will be on current state-of-the-art involving many times recent advances in training neural networks and novel architectures.
